*Don’t teach skills. Teach competences. . . . Computers can do better things than that.* – Sandy Stone (2007) at the European Graduate School  

I've been asked to: 1) outline what humanities graduate students need in terms of digital knowledge for the future, no matter what field they enter following graduation and 2) what might a three-course cross-disciplinary sequence in the foundations of the digital humanities look like.

Thanks to the Department of English at the University of Washington for inviting me to speak on this topic, and to the Simpson Center for the Humanities and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for their support. 

First, a disclosure of sorts . . . 

## My Background and Biases

* My academic background is mostly in "literary media" (a combination of science and technology studies, technoculture, multimodal composition and design, and research on 20th and 21st c. experimental literature and media). I do not, for instance, have a background in textual studies or humanities computing. 
* I tend to run with a rather capacious definition of digital humanities (DH): a combination of technical competences in computing or new media with research in a humanities discipline. I also tend to accept Manovich's five principles of new media (as a starting point, at least). 
* I try to avoid using the label, "DH"; it's a means and not an end (Kirschenbaum). I'm thus less interested in digital humanities as a term or field (including who or what "belongs") and more in work that entwines technical stuff with creative and critical methods. Such work is usually collaborative and transdisciplinary (a shared problem or concern approached through different disciplines and distinct forms of expertise).
* I'm totally fine with prototypes. Digital projects do not need to be fully developed products or polished/useful tools to be meaningful. Prototypes also serve important social and pedagogical functions.   

Where digital knowledge and course design are concerned, I've decided to approach both in the abstract: with detail, but without a specific setting or program in mind. A lot of what I'm going to say may already apply to what you're already doing at your institution (UW or elsewhere); however, my intent is to step away from the specificity of context and provide a more general resource that will allow us to first scan DH and its affordances for teaching and learning (if you will) and then locate the praxis of digital studies where we wish. I'm sure, too, that I'll miss or overlook something in the process. For example, I will not talk about undergraduate education, which is crucial and is changing rapidly with respect to new media and digital studies. Nevertheless, some of this material could and probably should apply to undergraduate course design and instruction.

## Praxis 

When I say "praxis," I'm referring to the enactment and diffraction of theory through situated knowledge (Haraway), embodied practice (Hayles), and "live" methods and prototyping (Back and Puwar). From my perspective, the ideal teaching and learning situation (in the context of digital studies, at least) is an entanglement of theory and practice, resulting in practitioner knowledge of where and why they draw the boundaries or "cuts" between discourse and matter or concepts and actions (Barad; Kember and Zylinska). And I use "digital studies" here (as opposed to DH) because some of the material, including methods and ostensible foundations, may not immediately appear to be unique to the humanities, invested (only) in DH, or taught only by humanities scholars or only in the humanities classroom.

So, with my own background and biases in mind, and with an orientation toward praxis, my teaching and learning aims (across multiple digital studies courses) usually prompt students to:  

* Identify and intervene in oppressive technologies (including matters of social justice, ethics, trust, and responsibility, while recognizing that "intervention" assumes various modes, from ideation to composition to implementation to community action); 
* Understand design and development as forms of inquiry with palpable contexts of use (comparable to writing or even to moving through an archive); 
* Approach projects from the middle (against hyperbolic rhetorics of innovation and disruption as well as lone male inventor myths);
* Attend to the cultural, social, and aesthetic dimensions of how this becomes that (an ontology of changes and versions, not originals or copies);
* Bridge macro, meso, and micro scales of interpretation (resisting the close/distant and critique/immersion binaries); and, 
* Refine knowledge amidst an abundance of information and gadgets, including knowing when to "logout" or "unplug," how to avoid scope creep, and why maintenance and carework are fundamental to (not a later consequence of) any project. 

But a lot of that doesn't sound very "digital." And I think that's important for humanities work: an instance of digital studies that is culture first, technology second. Still, I might locate the praxis of it all like so (with some apologies for the conspicuous pith): 

* **Critical technical practice (Science and Technology Studies)** (Agre): Identify and intervene in oppressive technologies (including matters of social justice, ethics, trust, and responsibility, while recognizing that "intervention" assumes various modes, from ideation to composition to implementation to community action); 
* **Reflexive iteration and trial-and-error experimentation (Design Studies)** (Balsamo): Understand design and development as forms of inquiry with palpable contexts of use (comparable to writing or even to moving through an archive); 
* **Provenance and documentation (History, Textual Studies, and Library and Information Studies)** (Getty): Approach projects from the middle (against hyperbolic rhetorics of innovation and disruption as well as lone male inventor myths);
* **Traversal and Transduction (Literary and Media Studies)** (Moulthrop and Grigar; Fuller): Attend to the cultural, social, and aesthetic dimensions of how this becomes that (an ontology of memory, changes, and versions, not storage, originals, and copies); 
* **Articulation (Cultural Studies)** (Grossberg; Hall; Morris): Bridge macro, meso, and micro scales of interpretation (resisting the close/distant and critique/immersion binaries); and, 
* **Minimal Computing (Labor Studies)** (Risam; Gil): Refine knowledge amidst an abundance of information and gadgets, including knowing when to "logout" or "unplug," how to avoid scope creep, and why maintenance and carework are fundamental to (and not a lateral consequence of) any project. 

When I design, develop, and teach my own courses in/around digital studies (e.g., [Digital Humanities 150](http://web.uvic.ca/~englblog/150f2015/), [Technology and Society 200](https://jentery.github.io/ts200/), [English 466 (Cultural Studies)](http://web.uvic.ca/~englblog/466f2015/), and [Digital Literary Studies 508](https://jentery.github.io/508v2/) at UVic), these aims routinely return me to questions such as: 

* In the contexts of teaching digital studies and DH, when does the content matter most? When does it influence methodology? And how does it determine or shape the method used? 
* How technical should I get? What can be done without computers or programming? When must some of the foundations be technical (command line and whatnot)? 
* What do students already know? What do they care most about? How can I be more aware of these investments and knowledge? 
* Which approaches to teaching are most conducive to both social change and experimentation? When and how should I get out of the way? 
* Do I even need to talk about "Digital Humanities" (the field) to teach this material? For whom does is that label significant? At this point, do students hear "Digital Humanities" and think, "Look! My prof just found the internet"? 

My responses to these questions depend on the course I am teaching, for whom, and to whom. Still, my experiences engaging them lead me to imagine several three-course cross-disciplinary sequences in the foundations of the digital humanities. I've prototyped them here. Pardon the rough edges.
