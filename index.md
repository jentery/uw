*Don’t teach skills. Teach competences. . . . Computers can do better things than that.* – Sandy Stone (2007) at the European Graduate School   

I've been asked to: 1) outline what humanities graduate students need in terms of digital knowledge for the future, no matter what field they enter following graduation, and 2) speak to what a three-course, cross-disciplinary sequence in the foundations of digital humanities might look like.

Thanks to the Department of English at the University of Washington for inviting me to speak on this topic, and to the Simpson Center for the Humanities and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for their support. 

First, a disclosure of sorts . . . 

## My Background and Biases

* My academic background is mostly in "literary media" (a combination of science and technology studies, technoculture, multimodal composition and design, and research on 20th and 21st c. experimental literature and media). I do not, for instance, have a background in textual studies or humanities computing. 
* I tend to run with a rather capacious definition of digital humanities (DH): a combination of technical competences in computing or new media with research in a humanities discipline. I also tend to accept Manovich's five principles of new media (at least as a starting point). 
* I try to avoid using the label, "DH"; it is a means and not an end (Kirschenbaum). I'm thus less interested in digital humanities as a term or field (including who or what "belongs") and more in work that entwines technical stuff with creative and critical methods. Such work is usually collaborative and transdisciplinary (involving a shared problem or concern approached through a combination of different disciplines and distinct forms of expertise).
* I'm totally fine with prototypes. Digital projects do not need to be fully developed products or polished/useful tools made in labs or centers to be meaningful. Prototypes serve important cultural, pedagogical, and artistic functions. I also lean toward the conjectural or speculative dimensions of digital studies (that is, my work does not involve proving anything with computers or quantification).    

Where digital knowledge and course design are concerned, I've decided for today to approach both in the abstract: with detail, but without a specific setting or program in mind. A lot of what I'm going to say may already apply to what you're already doing at your institution (UW or elsewhere); however, my intent is to step away from the specificity of context and provide a more general resource that will allow us to first scan DH and its affordances for teaching and learning and then locate the praxis of digital studies where we wish. I'm sure, too, that I'll miss or overlook something in the process. For example, I will not talk about undergraduate education, which is crucial and is changing rapidly with respect to new media and digital studies. Nevertheless, some of this material could and probably should apply to undergraduate course design and instruction.

## Praxis 

When I say "praxis," I'm referring to the enactment and diffraction of theory through situated knowledge (Haraway), embodied practice (Hayles), and "live" methods and prototyping (Back and Puwar). From my perspective, the ideal teaching and learning situation (in the context of digital studies) is an entanglement of theory with practice, resulting in practitioner knowledge of where and why they draw the boundaries or "cuts" between discourse and matter or concepts and actions (Barad; Kember and Zylinska). And I frequently use "digital studies" here (as opposed to DH) because some of the material, including methods and ostensible foundations, may not immediately appear to be unique to the humanities, invested (only) in DH, or taught only by humanities scholars or only in the humanities classroom.

## Aims of My Digital Studies Courses 

So, with my own background and biases in mind, and with an orientation toward praxis and identifying what may be helpful for students to know, my digital studies courses usually prompt students to:  

* Identify and intervene in oppressive technologies (including matters of social justice, ethics, trust, and responsibility, while recognizing that "intervention" assumes various modes, from ideation to composition to implementation to community action); 
* Understand design and development as forms of inquiry with palpable contexts of use (comparable to writing or even to moving through an archive); 
* Approach projects from the middle (against hyperbolic rhetorics of innovation, novelty, and disruption as well as lone male inventor myths);
* Attend to the cultural, social, and aesthetic dimensions of how this becomes that (an ontology of memory, changes, and versions, not storage, originals, and copies);
* Bridge macro, meso, and micro levels of interpretation (resisting the close/distant and critique/immersion binaries); and, 
* Refine knowledge amidst an abundance of information and gadgets, including knowing when to "logout" or "unplug," how to avoid scope creep, and why maintenance and carework are fundamental to (not a lateral consequence of) any project. 

But a lot of that doesn't sound very "digital." And I think that's important for humanities work: an instance of digital studies that is culture first, technology second. Still, I might locate the praxis of it all like so (with some apologies for the conspicuous pith): 

* **Critical Technical Practice (Science and Technology Studies)** (Agre): Identify and intervene in oppressive technologies (including matters of social justice, ethics, trust, and responsibility, while recognizing that "intervention" assumes various modes, from ideation to composition to implementation to community action); 
* **Reflexive Iteration and Trial-and-Error Experimentation (Design Studies)** (Balsamo): Understand design and development as forms of inquiry with palpable contexts of use (comparable to writing or even to moving through an archive); 
* **Provenance and Documentation (History, Textual Studies, and Library and Information Studies)** (Getty): Approach projects from the middle (against hyperbolic rhetorics of innovation and disruption as well as lone male inventor myths);
* **Traversal and Transduction (Literary and Media Studies)** (Moulthrop and Grigar; Fuller): Attend to the cultural, social, and aesthetic dimensions of how this becomes that (an ontology of memory, changes, and versions, not storage, originals, and copies); 
* **Articulation (Cultural Studies)** (Grossberg; Hall; Morris): Bridge macro, meso, and micro levels of interpretation (resisting the close/distant and critique/immersion binaries); and, 
* **Minimal Computing (Labor Studies)** (Risam; Gil): Refine knowledge amidst an abundance of information and gadgets, including knowing when to "logout" or "unplug," how to avoid scope creep, and why maintenance and carework are fundamental to (and not a lateral consequence of) any project. 

When I design, develop, and teach my own courses in/around digital studies (e.g., [Digital Humanities 150](http://web.uvic.ca/~englblog/150f2015/), [Technology and Society 200](https://jentery.github.io/ts200/), [English 466 (Cultural Studies)](http://web.uvic.ca/~englblog/466f2015/), and [Digital Literary Studies 508](https://jentery.github.io/508v2/) at UVic), the above aims routinely return me to questions such as: 

* In the contexts of teaching digital studies and DH, when does the content matter most? When does it influence methodology? And how does it determine or shape the method used? I ask these questions because DH courses are regularly framed as methods or skills courses.  
* How technical should I get? What can be done without computers or programming? When must some of the foundations be technical (involving the command line and whatnot)? I ask these questions because I'm conflicted: many humanities students regularly (and justifiably) ask why they should bother with code, and the practice of teaching and learning technical stuff can be time-consuming and frustrating, especially when you're new to it. Thus, I tend to favor low-tech approaches (e.g., [paper computers](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DbVLxBLU8AAh3is.jpg) and [unlearning the internet](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DaW4Xl5VwAAeqw8.jpg:large)). And yet, I like the idea of framing technical work (including programming) under the umbrella of writing and composition. You can argue and experiment with it (not just *use* it).   
* What do students already know? What do they care most about? How can I be more aware of these investments and knowledge? I ask these questions because I think my courses should be relevant to student needs and interests, and they should speak to present-day issues and concerns. I also realize that students are learning more and more digital stuff in K-12 settings. 
* Which approaches to teaching are most conducive to both social change and experimentation? When and how should I get out of the way? I ask these questions because I want to give students room to learn and build on their investments and backgrounds. Too often, digital studies courses begin with an assumption of lack (a banking model of education): "you don't know this, and here's how you should do it." The thing is, there are millions of ways to approach a single problem or concern through digital methods, and I believe it's possible for instructors to simultaneously use their expertise *and* check their assumptions and privileges at the classroom door.   
* Do I even need to talk about "Digital Humanities" (the field) to teach this material? For whom does is that label significant? At this point, do students hear "Digital Humanities" and think, "Look! My prof just found the internet"? I ask this question because, again, I think DH is a means and not an end.  

## Some Possible Three-Course Sequences 

Ultimately, the granularity of my responses to these questions depends on the courses I am teaching, for whom, and to whom. Still, my experiences in engaging such questions lead me to imagine several three-course, cross-disciplinary sequences in the foundations of the digital humanities. For the purposes of discussion (but not proscription), I've prototyped them below. Pardon the rough edges; and, to state the obvious, selection of content (e.g., collections, corpora, media, genres, histories,  theories, and case studies) would dramatically affect each of these sequences. 

### Stewardship 

This sequence overlaps the Humanities with work mostly in Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums (GLAM). 

* **Digitization**: This course introduces you to various 2D and 3D techniques for digitizing materials. Techniques may include text editing, encoding (XML), transforming (XSLT), character recognition, photogrammetry, video and audio recording, cryptography, data modeling, and 2D and 3D scanning. Emphasis is placed on the affordances of digitization for humanities research and its historical, cultural, and political dimensions. 
* **Collection**: This course introduces you to various techniques for collecting, preserving, and disseminating digital and digitized materials. Techniques may include cataloging, indexing, searching, metadata, building repositories, infrastructure assessments, simulation, emulation, migration, and computer forensics. Emphasis is placed on stewarding humanities materials as well as stewardship as a social, cultural, and political activity.  
* **Exhibition**: This course introduces you to various techniques for curating and exhibiting digital and digitized materials. Techniques may include interface and interaction design, narration, databases (SQL), licensing, attribution, and content management (Omeka). Emphasis is placed on matters of access, the cultural dimensions of curation, and the intricacies of representing historical materials and groups. 

The sequence could build on work by, for instance, Chris Bourg, Geoffrey Bowker, Susan Brown, Julia Flanders, Carla Hayden, Bergis Jules, Martha Lampland, Matthew Kirschenbaum, Trevor Muñoz, Bethany Nowviskie, Loretta Parham, Dot Porter, Roxane Shirazi, Susan Leigh Star, and Amanda Visconti.    

The benefits of this sequence include scaffolded preparation for fields in or related to stewardship and memory work. Each course could also attend to a variety of material particulars across media and methods, and the sequence could link stewardship to communication, culture, and social responsibility. It could also build upon and amplify existing collections at the hosting institution. It requires some investment in the more technical dimensions of digital humanities.  

### Computational Analysis 

This sequence overlaps the Humanities with work mostly in Computer Science, the Social Sciences, and Information Studies. 

* **Processing**: This course introduces you to using computers to process and interpret materials. Techniques may include pre-processing data, text editing, the command line (Bash), spreadsheets, programming (Python), statistics (R), diffing, text mining, topic modeling, and machine learning. Emphasis is placed on the editorial choices made during processing and understanding how computation affects interpretation. 
* **Expression**: This course introduces you to expressing materials as data. Techniques may include the command line (Bash), programming (Python and JavaScript), interface and interaction design, and graphical, (geo)spatial, temporal, and sonic expression. Emphasis is placed on data expression as a form of argumentation and social responsibility.  
* **Analysis**: This course introduces you to analyzing data for the purposes of disseminating and publishing findings. Techniques may include macroanalysis, surface reading, close reading, cultural analytics, cinemetrics, and algorhythmics. Emphasis is placed on combining qualitative and quantitative methods and bridging macro-, meso-, and micro-levels of interpretation.

The benefits of this sequence include semi-scaffolded preparation for data- and computation-oriented humanities work and an investment in conducting computational analysis without relying too heavily on tools and templates. It requires significant investment in the more technical dimensions of digital humanities. 

### Design and Communication 

This sequence overlaps the Humanities with work mostly in Fine Arts and Engineering.

* **Composition**: This course introduces you to multimodal composition. Techniques may include writing for the web, visual programming, and the production and post-production of audio, film, images, and text. Emphasis is placed on scholarly publishing and contexts of use and interpretation.  
- **Design**: This course introduces you to design's role in the scholarly communication process. Techniques may include accessibility as well as graphic, interface, interaction, experience, adversarial, and speculative design. Emphasis is placed on inquiry and cultural practice.   
- **Experiments**: This course surveys histories of experimental media and their relevance to present-day practice. Areas studied may include electronic literature, net art, design fiction, literary media, book arts, sound and performance art, tactical media, media archaeology, infrastructure studies, and installation work. Emphasis is placed on the importance of media aesthetics to cultural, social, and political practices.
