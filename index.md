Sandy Stone quote - 

I've been asked to outline what humanities graduate students need in terms of digital knowledge for the future, no matter what field they enter following graduation and 2) what might a three-course cross-disciplinary sequence in the foundations of the digital humanities look like.

### Biases 

* no humanities computing 
* background in literary media (combination of science and technology studies, multimodal composition, and experimental literature)
* less about the field and more about the work (journal placement)
* I'm totally fine with prototypes.
* My area is comparative media studies.  
* def of DH 
* issues are situated in institutional context and student needs + desires 

Praxis through . . . 

## Social and Cultural Theory 

* Identify and intervene in oppressive technologies 
* Understand design and development as forms of inquiry  
* Approach projects from the middle 
* Attend to the cultural, social, and aesthetic dimensions of how this becomes that 
* -- the macro, meso, and micro scales of interpretation 
* Refine knowledge and be aware of what the don't need to know (scope creep)

## Methods 

* Critical technical practice: Identify and intervene in oppressive technologies 
* Iteration and trial-and-error experimentation: Understand design and development as forms of inquiry  
* Provenance and documentation: Approach projects from the middle 
* Transduction: Attend to the cultural, social, and aesthetic dimensions of how this becomes that 
* Articulation:  the macro, meso, and micro scales of interpretation 


is the field too expansive--is the tent too big--for a three-course sequence in the foundations of digital humanities? 

Course sequences 

Content matters, hence my own interests in comparative media studies. While these are focused on methods and methodologies, the courses need to --- content or domain knowledge/expertise. Culture first, technology a close second.   

## Stewardship 

This sequence overlaps the humanities with work in Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums (GLAM). 

- Digitization: This course introduces you to various 2D and 3D techniques for digitizing materials. Techniques may include encoding, photogrammetry, video and audio recording, cryptography, modeling, and 2D and 3D scanning. Emphasis is placed on the affordances of digitization for humanities research and its historical, cultural, and political dimensions.  
- Collection: This course introduces you to various techniques for collecting, preserving, and disseminating digital and digitized materials. Techniques may include cataloging, indexing, building repositories, infrastructure assessments, simulation, emulation, migration, and computer forensics. Emphasis is placed on stewarding humanities materials and stewardship as a social, cultural, and political activity.  
- Exhibition: This course introduces you to various techniques for curating and exhibiting digital and digitized materials. 

Practitioners and terms: Susan Brown (cultural formation), Julia Flanders (), J.J. Gibson (affordance) Martha Lampland (metadata), Trevor Munoz (), Bethany Nowviskie (carework), Roxane Shirazi (labour), Susan Leigh Star (boundary object),  

Benefits: scaffolded preparation for ; historical and archival work; attention to materiality; links stewardship to communication 

Downsides: directed a specific group of students  

## Cultural Analytics

This sequence overlaps the humanities with Computer Science, the Social Sciences, and Information Studies. 

- Processing: diff'ing, machine learning, 
- Expression: 
- Analysis: 

Practitioners and terms: 

Benefits: scaffolded preparation for ; 

Downsides: need for statistics and computer programming; also, knowledge of 

## Design and Communication 

This sequence overlaps the humanities with Fine Arts and Engineering.

- Composition: 
- Design: 
interface, interaction, experience, accessibility 
- Experiments:  (e-lit, net art, design fiction, literary media, book arts)


Practitioners and terms: 

Benefits: scaffolded preparation for ; bridges aesthetics with history and contexts of use; 

Downsides: 

## Social Justice 

This sequence overlaps the humanities with the Social Sciences. 

- critical technical practice and STS 
- digital ethics (social justice and decolonization) - labour 
- action research 

Practitioners and terms: 

Benefits: scaffolded preparation for ; appeals to students doing theoretical and justice work; 

Downsides: 

## Foundations v1

This sequences is anchored in Digital Humanities as a field. It is methods-forward. 

- digital methods survey (with a kit) 
- remediation workshop (from encoding to media archaeology)
- action research workshop (from to minimal computing)

Practitioners and terms: 

Benefits: flexibility for students, faculty, and staff; 

Downsides: could change dramatically from year to year

## Foundations v2

This sequence is anchored in the praxis of digital studies (or media studies). It is project-forward. 

- prototyping history
- prototyping futures
- ethics and production workshop  

Benefits: 

Downsides: risk of bypassing some foundations in the name of context and practice
